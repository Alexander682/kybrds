          A keyboard is for putting information including letters, words and numbers into your computer. You press the individual buttons on the keyboard when you type. The number keys across the top of the keyboard are also found on the right of the keyboard. The letter keys are in the centre of the keyboard. There are two types of keyboards, mechanical and membrane. 
        <p id="ptwo">The mechanical switch uses mechanical detection systems as said in the name, but the membrane switch uses rubber dome to resis the push and the press of the button is detected directly by the PCB. There are 3 types of mechanical switches. The first one is Linear. The secound one is Tactile and the third one is Clicky. The linear switch has a nice smooth sound and a smooth fealing. The Tactile switch has the feel of a Clicky switch but does not sound as loud as the Clicky switch. It is great for games and also for work at a office. And the Clicky switch is as it's said: clicky. It is extremely lound and has a very unpleasant sound. The only thing that you can do with the clicky switch is play games.<p>
        <p id="pthree">They are so loud that it is inpossible to use it in office. The rubber dome switches (membrane) are used more often in laptops and low budget keyboards that are used for office work only. There are some gaming membrane keyboards but they have very high latency and are not so pleasant to the touch. That's why the mechanical switches are used fur building higher quality custom mechanical keyboards. A regular membrane keyboard costs about 15-35 dollars. A nice mechanical custom built keyboard can cost up to 2000 dollars! That's a high price for a keyboard but for some people it's a hobby.<p></p>
